# bat_ball_game
Hello Guys, I've built a fun game that you can play on a webpage. In this game, you control a bat to keep a bouncing ball from falling off the screen. When you start, you'll see the game area and a "Start Game" button. Once you hit the button, the ball will bounce around, and you'll use your mouse to move the bat left and right to hit the ball. Each time you hit the ball, your score goes up, and you can see it on the screen. But if the ball falls, the game ends, and your final score is shown. You can restart and try to beat your score.
